## Challenge:
 
#### Write a selenium scraper that takes two seat numbers as input, selects the seats from this page (https://static.gordiansoftware.com/) and then takes a screenshot of the "Seat Selection" element. The output should look something like the attached image. It should work if the selected seat is a regular seat, and also if it's on an exit row
